## Proposed Project
The Covid BusinessPro web application is designed to collect information to aid with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our app aims to help the people of Regina feel safe within their business organizations, and to aid local businesses with reopening operations during this time. Information will be gathered by user's responses to a series of well-designed questions that assist with decision making such as isolation efforts and contact tracing. The app provides graphical representation of the data, keeping track of trends. Users of the app can expect to:
* Keep track of symptoms via a checklist/database of symptoms
* Keep a log of locations you have visited for contact tracing purposes
* Be able to track trends, clusters and the spread of symptoms. 

## Methodology and Technologies
Our app provides an immediate alert to an employer, triggered when an employee has at least 5 corresponding COVID-19 symptoms. The app has a contact tracing component, which supplies an immediate chain of contacts within the business, reflecting who employees were in contact with, and in which areas of the building, or departments. Generated data helps to optimize the business response to take precautionary measures such as mandating the employee stay home and receive testing, and for the business to initiate a “deep cleaning” of related areas. Our app provides real time data for businesses to track trends, clusters and the spread of symptoms. Our group will combine APIs and learn new programming techniques that can help us create live maps. We will use designated databases geared for business organizations. We will have login and signup pages which will be encrypted, and personal data will not be sold or distributed. Our app will follow PIPEDA and HIPAA guidelines. We will store user data into our database and reflect that on our map and in graphical representations of data.
